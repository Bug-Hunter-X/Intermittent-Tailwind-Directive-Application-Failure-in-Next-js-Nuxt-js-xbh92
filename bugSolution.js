The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and that its purge mechanism is properly set up to avoid stripping out necessary CSS classes during the build process.  Here is an example of how this might be handled in a `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

If the issue persists, verifying the integrity of the build process and any custom build plugins is crucial.  In some cases, re-building the application from scratch can resolve the issue.  Consider adding explicit `purge` options to include all necessary CSS classes if you encounter more specific cases.
